## About
My Name is Tushaar, I'm currently a Data Science Student at IIT Madras and a Cybersecurity Virtual Intern at JP Morgan Chase & Co where I'm working on the applications of Data Science & AI in Cybersecurity. 
I have completed Virtual Internships at Amazon, British Airways, Cognizant, KPMG and Tata.
My Tech journey started back when I was 6 years old (2011) when I casually learnt 3D Plans & Design using AutoCAD, 3Ds Max and SketchUp for fun. I started with Software Development at 13 years of age (2019) and I have worked on various projects of different kinds. Started out with Game Development (C#, C++, unity, unreal engine 4) and Back-end Software Development, taught Game development at the age of 14-15 (2020). Then, I made the switch to Data Science & Machine Learning out of interest and the fact that it fascinated me the most out of all the other technologies that I have worked with.
